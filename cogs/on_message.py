    Bot responses to messages in chat
    
    Detail:
    Bot responds to simple yes or no questions, along with greetings and goodbyes.
    It also detects certain curse words and sends a warning when they are detected.

    (The bots a little silly so he can be random at times :))

    **Done working on FOR NOW**

    For future works:
        - Add more curse words (such as slurs)
        - Fix warning responses AFTER ADDING MORE GAMES AND COMMANDS
        - Fix when so bot does not respond to "him" (etc), thinking its "hi"
        - if possible, update runtime (for learning purpose)
            - same thing for curse words (classy == ass according to bot)
