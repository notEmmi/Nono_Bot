# Nono Discord Bot

This is my first Discord bot. The purpose of the bot is to have multiple mini-games and some basic commands.
**Remember, this is still in work.**

## Basic Commands

2. **!help** - Provides a list of available commands and mini games.
3. **!ping** - Checks the bot's latency.
4. **!info** - Provides information about the bot.

## Mini Games

1. **!tictactoe** - Play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with another user.
2. **!hangman** - Play a game of Hangman.
3. **!trivia** - Answer trivia questions and earn points.
4. **!rps** - Play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the bot.
5. **!numberguess** - Try to guess the number the bot is thinking of.

### Future Plans

- Add more mini-games.
- Implement user score tracking and leaderboards.
- Enhance the help command with more detailed descriptions and examples.

### Invite Link

Coming soon :(
