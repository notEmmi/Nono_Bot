# Nono Discord Bot

This is my first Discord bot. The purpose of the bot is to have multiple mini games and some basic commands, as well as interact with messages such as answering questions, issuing warnings for curse words, and responding to greetings and goodbyes.
**Remember, this is still in work.**

## Basic Commands

1. **!help** - Provides a list of available commands.
2. **!ping** - Checks the bot's latency.
3. **!info** - Provides information about the bot.
4. **!game** - Provides list of available mini games.

## Mini Games

1. **!truthordare** - 
2. **!guessthatcharacter** - Try to guess the character from the image.
3. **!trivia** - Answer trivia questions and earn points.
4. **!rps** - Play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the bot.
5. **!numberguess** - Try to guess the number the bot is thinking of.

### Future Plans

- Add more mini-games.
- Implement user score tracking and leaderboards.
- Enhance the help command with more detailed descriptions and examples.

### Invite Link

Coming soon :(
