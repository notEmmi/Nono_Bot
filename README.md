# Nono Discord Bot

This is my first Discord bot. The purpose of the bot is to have multiple mini-games and some basic commands, as well as interact with messages such as answering questions, issuing warnings for curse words, and responding to greetings and goodbyes.
**Remember, this is still in work.**

## Basic Commands
**work in progress**
1. **!help** - Provides a list of available commands.
2. **!ping** - Checks the bot's latency.
3. **!info** - Provides information about the bot.
4. **!game** - Provides list of available mini games.

## Mini Games

1. **!truthordare** - not started
2. **!guessthatcharacter** - **work in progress**
3. **!trivia** - not started
4. **!rps** - not started
5. **!numberguess** - not started

### Future Plans
